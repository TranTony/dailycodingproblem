#This problem was asked by Google.
#Given the root to a binary tree, 
#implement serialize(root),
#which serializes the tree into a string, 
#and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
#For example, given the following Node class

#There are many ways to serialize and deserialize a binary tree, 
#so don't worry if your solution differs from this one. 
#We will be only going through one possible solution.


# +++++++++++++++++++++++SOLUTION+++++++++++++++
# The solution from DailyProblem.com
#We can approach this problem by first figuring out 
#what we would like the serialized tree to look like. 
#Ideally, it would contain the minimum information 
#required to encode all the necessary information about the binary tree. 
#ne possible encoding might be to borrow S-expressions from Lisp. 
#The tree Node(1, Node(2), Node(3)) 
#would then look like '(1 (2 () ()) (3 () ()))', 
#where the empty brackets denote nulls.

#To minimize data over the hypothetical wire, 
#we could go a step further and prune out some unnecessary brackets. 
#We could also replace the 2-character '()' with '#'. 
#We can then infer leaf nodes by their form 'val # #' 
#and thus get the structure of the tree that way. 
#Then our tree would look like 1 2 # # 3 # #.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def serialize(root):
    if root is None:
        return '#'
    return '{} {} {}'.format(root.val, serialize(root.left), serialize(root.right))

def deserialize(data):
    def helper():
        val = next(vals)
        if val == '#':
            return None
        node = Node(int(val))
        node.left = helper()
        node.right = helper()
        return node
    vals = iter(data.split())
    return helper()

node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'
